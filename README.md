#Introduction

## Riga Data Science Club
Riga Data Science Club is a non-profit organization to share ideas, experience and build machine learning projects together.

Our goal is to drive progress in the machine learning and artificial intelligence field.

## Meetup #9: Reinforcement Learning Basics
The purpose of the meetup and this repository is to give basic understanding of Reinforcement Learning by practice. 
We are going to use [gym](https://gym.openai.com/) learning environment to do experiments, so make sure Python 3.6+ is installed with all other necessary packages as described in #Setup
 

# Setup
The following setup instructions are partially copied from OpenAI spinning up resource: 
https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/installation.html

Feel free to use python environment manager of your choice or direct python installation.

## Anaconda
Download and install Anaconda. Follow the installation instructions for Anaconda [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/). 
Then create a conda Python 3.6 env for organizing packages for the purpose of this meetup:
```
conda create -n gym python=3.6
```
To use Python from the environment you just created, activate the environment with:
```
conda activate gym
```

## Q-learning
What’s ‘Q’?
The ‘q’ in q-learning stands for quality. Quality in this case represents how useful a given action is in gaining some future reward.
